# Introduction

Bazel is a tool for building and testing applications. The same thing can be performed by Make, CMakelists or Gradle.
What makes Bazel different? It can develop application for different platforms, with different codebases and is highly parallel. The largest repos are built mostly with Bazel [now](https://bazel.build/users.html).

# Installation

Download and [install Bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/install.html).

# Terminologies

### Workspace
The main directory of the project from where all the sources files are accessible. A workspace is made when bazel finds a `WORKSPACE` or `WORKSPACE.bazel` file. 
```
  # Here repo is the workspace and contains WORKSPACE file
  repo/src/module1/BUILD
  repo/src/module1/runner1.cc
  repo/src/module2/BUILD
  repo/src/module2/runner2.cc
  repo/src/tests/data/cases.txt
  repo/src/tests/BUILD
  repo/src/tests/pass.py
  repo/WORKSPACE
```



### Repositories
The directory containing the `WORKSPACE` file, is also called as `@`. We can also have several external repositories for a project.    
```
  # Here @repo can be seen as a repository
  repo/src/module1/BUILD
  repo/src/module1/runner1.cc
  repo/src/module2/BUILD
  repo/src/module2/runner2.cc
  repo/src/tests/data/cases.txt
  repo/src/tests/BUILD
  repo/src/tests/pass.py
  repo/WORKSPACE
```


### Packages
All related files for a particular task in the source directory are called as packages. Each package is defined by `BUILD` file.
```
  # Here module1, module2 and tests are defined as packages, Not data
  repo/src/module1/BUILD
  repo/src/module1/runner1.cc
  repo/src/module2/BUILD
  repo/src/module2/runner2.cc
  repo/src/tests/data/cases.txt
  repo/src/tests/BUILD
  repo/src/tests/pass.py
  repo/WORKSPACE
```

### Targets and Labels
Contents of the package are called as targets.
The contents can be files or rules(defined later). 
The files can be source files(code files) or generated files(.o/.pyc/.osx/.exe etc).

The name of the target is called as label. Each label is uniquely pointing to a target.
So given the previous example, we can have following targets.
```
@repo//src/module1:runner1
```
```
@repo//src/module2:runner2
```
```
@repo//src/tests:pass
```
```
@repo//src/tests:data/cases.txt
```
The naming also allows `//src/tests:pass` if we are inside repo folder.
For external repositories, the name should be given in full.

All naming conventions are standard in the above cases i.e. (//,.,..,<space>) are not allowed as names of either package or target.
They all should be meaningful in nature.


### Rules
It is way to generate outputs from the given inputs. Now for each language we have different rules. For C/C++, we have `cc_binary` rule.
For python, we have `py_binary` rule. So we have [given rules](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/main/rules.html) for each file.

```
  # runner1 is a C++ file, dependencies are defined in deps
  cc_binary(
    name = "runner1",
    srcs = ["runner1.cc"],
    deps = [
        "//absl/base",
        "//absl/strings",
    ],
)
```
  
  
### BUILD files
The build file is comparised of following sections.
  
#### Extensions
Use the `load` statement, to import something which can be a particular rule, symbol or constant.  

```
  load("//src/custom:file.bzl", "custom_package")
```
  
#### Rules
All the standard available rules are given here.

#### Dependencies
- srcs
  Files or rules
- deps
  Symbols, libraries, generated files
- data
  txt,image,audio etc


# Working with Bazel


# Bazel commands

```
  bazel --version -> gives version
  bazel build <labels> -> builds the package
  bazel-bin/<label-names>/<target> -> executes the package
  bazel query --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(<target>)" --output graph --> generates the graph
  
```
