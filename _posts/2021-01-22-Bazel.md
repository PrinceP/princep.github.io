# Introduction

Bazel is a tool for building and testing applications. The same thing can be performed by Make, CMakelists or Gradle.
What makes Bazel different? It can develop application for different platforms, with different codebases and is highly parallel. The largest repos are built mostly with Bazel [now](https://bazel.build/users.html).

# Installation
